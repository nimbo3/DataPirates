# Doodle search engine

The Search engine is a thorough implementation to crawl websites. links are taken from a queue, and after checking for politeness and duplicates, their HTML docs are fetched and parsed.Finally docs are saved into databases..
This search engine is considered to be used in a way that is suitable for our usecase, but you can change it. You can setup the necessary tools according to our [wiki](https://github.com/nimbo3/DataPirates/wiki) page.

## Getting Started
First of all, DONâ€™T PANIC. It will take 5 minutes to get the gist of what DataPirates SearchEngine is all about.

### Prerequisites
Before using the searchEngine you have setup the following tools:
* kafka
* hadoop
* hbase
* zookeeper
* elasticsearch
* redis  

A complete explanation about what version to use and how to install them is available in [wiki](https://github.com/nimbo3/DataPirates/wiki) page.

### Installing

* [Download](https://github.com/nimbo3/DataPirates/archive/master.zip) and unzip the Elasticsearch official distribution.
* Download and install maven 3+
* Create .jar file with running `mvn clean package -DskipTests` in the source directory. This will create a fat-jar in target directory of each module.
* Run jar file with `java -jar *.jar` command
